.SH NAME
quota.conf \- configuration file for remote quota program
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B quota
reads a list of filesystems from the
.I "quota.conf"
configuration file.  Filesystems are one per line, with no provision for
continuation lines.  A ``#'' character anywhere on a line is used to begin
a comment.  Each line has the following format:
.IP
   description:hostname:remote_path:percent[:nolimit]
.LP
.I "description" 
is the path that will be displayed by the quota program,
typically the local mount point.
.LP
.I "hostname" 
is the name of the NFS server exporting the file system, or
the string ``lustre'' if the file system type is Lustre.
.LP
.I "remote_path"
is the NFS server-side path of file system, or
the local mount point if the file system type is Lustre.
.LP
\fIpercent\fR is the percentage of hard quota which, when exceeded,
causes quota to warn the user.  This can be used as a simpler alternative
to soft quotas if desired.  Set to zero to disable.
.LP
\fInolimit\fR is an optional flag that indicates that this file system
has no limits set so don't bother querying it when \fBquota\fR is run
without the \fI-v\fR option.
